# rdp-ssh-scanner
Scans an IP Adress of your choice for RDP ports that are open (and connectable). Also scans for open and connectable SSH ports.

If you want to change the range of ports it scans, go into the python file and change the "ip_range" value to whatever you want.
make sure that you change it for the right option (ssh or rdp)
